Hello!, my name is Moshood, and I'm a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate with knowledge of software design, development and testing. I have about 1.5 years experience in software engineering with keen interest in building outstanding web experiences, scalable systems and shipping reliable applications. I've got excellent analytical and programming skills to thrive as an entry level software engineer, and I'm also a great team player.

I also possess the following qualities:

- I love feedbacks and I act on them so much.
- I love maps and I wish to travel more to a lot of places.
- I love Mountaineering.
- I love Pair Programming sessions.
- I learn, unlearn and relearn: knowledge isn't static, no one is an island of knowledge and to grow, we need learn from mistakes and update our knowledge bank.

Here's a feedback I got from my manager during my Summer Internship at [Shopify](https://shopify.com)
